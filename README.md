# A potential-game approach to distributed trajectory optimization leveraging MPC and SCP
This repository is based on the Casadi[https://web.casadi.org/] pacakge. The goal is to achieve efficient online trajectory optimization leveraging both distributed MPC and distributed sequential convex programming.
